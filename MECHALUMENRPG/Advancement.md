# Advancement

At the end of the [[Mission Generation Tables|Mission]], **PCs** regain all lost health, gain 1 point to an attribute of their choice, and increase their maximum health by 1.

If the mission was a . . . 
	 . . . failure, each **PC** gains 2 [[Reputation]].
	 . . . partial success, each **PC** gains 3 [[Reputation]].
	 . . . full success, each **PC** gains 4 [[Reputation]].
Each **PC** gains this [[Reputation]] separately and can spend it on their own.

Players may spend newfound [[Reputation]] to buy [[Weapons]]. [[Rigs]] may not have more than 1 [[Weapons|Weapon]] equipped at a time.
