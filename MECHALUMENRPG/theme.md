**BRO ITS FUCKING MECHS WITH LIVING PLANTS GROWING IN EM FIGHTING TO THE DEATH FOR CONTROL OF A RUSTING WORLD.** Its **Power Fantasy Solarpunk Mecha**. **Power Fantasy** means means the players should feel powerful and strong while playing, **Solarpunk** is a genre in which steampunk is fused with living plants and sun-based contraptions, and **Mecha** is a world inhabited by giant robots. What's cooler than giant robots. Mechs called [[Rigs]] are fused out of metal and plant matter. 3 (soon more) [[Factions]] control this godforsaken earth: the republic, legions of mindless servants spreading propaganda across the land, the botanists, and underground resistance fighting not just from the trees, but using them as weapons, and the sky legion, a tight knit group of emissaries looking to protect their culture from all comers.
