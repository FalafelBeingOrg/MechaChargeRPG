# Combat

**Combat** is meant be fast and lethal for enemies. Your **PCs** should look **Fucking Awesome**. Combat is tracked in **Rounds** and **Turns**. Each **Round** each **PC** will get their chance to **Move**, **Act**, and use any available [[Mods]]. At the end of all of the **PCs** turns, the **GM** will act. This cycle is repeated until the battle is over. 

On your turn, you can first **Move** to any [[Ranges|Range]] of their enemies within reason, adjusting other enemy and **PC** distances as necessary. Then, you can take one **Action**, usually consisting of a roll to check if they either are able to perform something physical, or attack an [[Enemies|Enemy]]. You may also use [[Mods]] by spending the required [[Sol]]. When a **PCs** action has a consequence, the **GM** can use enemy forces, inflicting their **Harm** value or using one of their **Moves**, or introduce an additional difficulty or complexity for the players to confront.

On the **GMs** turn, they introduce a **Big Change** to the battlefield. This could be a shift in conditions, a third party showing up, or another complication. **Drops** also spawn from dead [[Enemies]]. Roll a d6 per [[Enemies|Enemy]]. On a 1 to 3 that [[Enemies|Enemy]] drops a [[Shield Cores|Shield Core]], on a 4 to 6 it drops a [[Sol]]. Players quickly decide who gets what. Enemies do not **Act** on the **GMs** turn. They only act as a result of player rolls.

When an [[Enemies|Enemy]]'s' health drops to 0, it is killed or destroyed. When a **PCs** health drops to 0, refer to [[Health]].
