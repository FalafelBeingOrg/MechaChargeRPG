# Health

**PCs** start with 6 to 9 **Health** depending on their [[Rigs|Rig]]'s [[Builds|Build]].

If a **PC** hits 0 **Health** for any reason during a scene, they are removed from the scene. Player death is not really a part of **Under the Rusted Star**. If you want to modify the game such that player death is more of a possibility feel free, but know that it will divert some of the game's focus from power fantasy.
